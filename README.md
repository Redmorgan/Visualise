This application can either be running using the expo client, by loading the APK file into an Android emulator, or by loading the APK into an Android device.
</br>IMPORTANT: If you choose to run using expo, it must be run using an Android device.

# Expo
In order to run the application running expo there are few steps you must take:
</br>1. Node.js
</br>The first thing you need to do is install Node.js, goto https://nodeks.org/en/ and download the latest version. Install it and run the following command in your CMD terminal to check wheter it's installed **node -v** Ensure your node is version v14.18.0 or higher.
</br>
</br>2. Expo
</br>Next we need to install Expo and React-Native which will be installed as a dependency.
</br>In a terminal do the following:
</br>
</br>**npm install --global expo-cli**
</br>
</br>It might take a bit of time,. Once finished, you might get some warnings, but they are for additional dependencies - so we can ignore them for now. Run **expo -V.**
